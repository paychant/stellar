### What we are building on Stellar

Through our ramp SDK, we want to connect XLM and USD Coin (Stellar) to all of Africa's traditional payment rails, allowing African users to seamlessly on-ramp and off-ramp directly on all self-custodial wallets, DEX, or dApps that are built on Stellar.

Proof of Intent:

- Create Stellar account
- Check XLM account balance
- View transactions that occurred on an account
- Submit transaction
